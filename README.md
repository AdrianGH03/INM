## 🎧💡 Why INM over Spotify's recommended?

- Spotify’s recommendations often feel repetitive, relying on what’s trending, popular, or only top genres of the playlist. I wanted a tool that analyzes my playlists and pulls fresh suggestions for all tracks from Deezer to break out of that bubble. INM helps me discover tracks I wouldn’t normally find, offering more variety and truly personalized results. INM keeps your playlist sounding the same, with a different vibe each time.
